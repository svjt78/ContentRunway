How agents bind to tools (and why it works) 1) Binding = registering callable functions with explicit I/O contracts • Each agent is created with a tools=[...] list of Python callables. Those callables have stable, explicit signatures (arguments + return schema) and are passed to the agent at construction time. The LLM can then select and invoke them during reasoning.  • Example (User Intent Agent): the agent is given two tools—set_perceived_user_goal(kind_of_graph, graph_description, tool_context) and approve_perceived_user_goal(tool_context)—and its instructions tell it precisely when to call which tool. This narrows the response space and forces structured output through tool arguments.  2) A shared, mutable ToolContext.state is the backbone • Tools read/write workflow state via tool_context.state, acting like a scratchpad (e.g., save perceived_user_goal, then “promote” it to approved_user_goal after explicit user approval). This separates exploratory “working memory” from committed work specifications.  • The intent agent uses this pattern to stage a goal before approval; later steps rely only on the approved key.  3) Instructions explicitly map conversational steps to tool calls • The agent prompt includes a mini-protocol: 1. ask clarifying Qs, 2. call set_perceived_user_goal, 3. show the perception, 4. on user confirmation, call approve_perceived_user_goal. This makes tool use predictable and auditable.  4) Read vs Write tool separation enforces safe workflows • In the Schema phase you define two agent roles with different tool sets: o Proposal agent (read + write): can fetch inputs (get_approved_user_goal, get_approved_files, sample_file, search_file), then write construction rules via propose_node_construction, propose_relationship_construction, and can remove proposals.  

o Critic agent (read-only): has only read tools (get_*, sample_file, search_file) and returns verdict/feedback into feedback state; it cannot mutate the construction plan directly. This enforces the “critic pattern.”  5) Tools themselves validate preconditions and return structured results • search_file is a grep-like helper with normalized success/error payloads; schema tools check presence of required columns before writing to the plan, and return tool_success/tool_error with guidance. This nudges the LLM to recover from failures and try again with better arguments.  • propose_node_construction / propose_relationship_construction write into a single PROPOSED_CONSTRUCTION_PLAN dict in state, keyed by labels/types, making subsequent reads and diffs straightforward.  6) Looping + escalation wire the tools into an iterative refinement flow • A LoopAgent runs [proposal → critic → stop-check] up to max_iterations. The CheckStatusAndEscalate agent inspects feedback (set by the critic) and decides whether to stop. This composes tool-using agents into a control loop without giving the critic write access.  7) “Agent-as-a-tool” enables higher-level orchestration • A top-level coordinator agent treats the whole schema_refinement_loop as a single tool (agent_tool.AgentTool(...)). It can then: o call the loop to (re)generate a proposal, o fetch the latest plan via get_proposed_construction_plan, o record approval via approve_proposed_construction_plan. This pattern lets you nest complex subgraphs behind a single callable surface.   End-to-end call/flow sketch 1. User Intent Agent o Chat → clarifications → set_perceived_user_goal(...) → show back to user → on “yes”: approve_perceived_user_goal(...) (state now has approved_user_goal).  2. Schema Proposal Loop 

o Proposal agent loads approved_user_goal + approved_files, samples files, validates IDs with search_file, and writes node/rel rules into PROPOSED_CONSTRUCTION_PLAN.  o Critic agent loads plan + files, uses read tools to test claims (uniqueness, connectivity, redundancy), then sets feedback = 'valid' or retry: <bullets>.  o Stop-check reads feedback and either escalates (stop) or loops.  3. Coordinator (optional) o Treat the whole loop as one tool; present plan to user; on approval call approve_proposed_construction_plan.   Design patterns you’re using (and can reuse) • Staged approval: write to perceived_*, promote to approved_* only after explicit consent. Keeps provenance clean and reproducible.  • Critic pattern with read-only tools: safe, testable review loop that pressures the proposer to justify choices with actual file evidence (search_file).  • Single source of truth in state: PROPOSED_CONSTRUCTION_PLAN acts like a mini-DB (add/remove/get), simplifying cross-agent coordination.  • Agent-as-tool composition: encapsulate complex flows behind a single callable and keep top-level orchestration simple.   Quick suggestions • Add lightweight schema for tool return values (e.g., pydantic models) to make outputs even more robust to LLM variability. • Consider adding a validate_plan tool that performs static checks (e.g., “all relationships reference defined nodes”) to reduce critic iterations. • Persist approved_* artifacts to storage with versioning so runs are auditable.
